/// A simple material design dialog.

///
/// Choices are normally represented using [SimpleDialogOption] widgets. If
/// other widgets are used, see [contentPadding] for notes regarding the

/// For dialogs that inform the user about a situation, consider using an

///
/// Typically passed as the child widget to [showDialog], which displays the
/// dialog.
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// In this example, the user is asked to select between two options. These
/// options are represented as an enum. The [showDialog] method here returns
/// a [Future] that completes to a value of that enum. If the user cancels
/// the dialog (e.g. by hitting the back button on Android, or tapping on the
/// mask behind the dialog) then the future completes with the null value.
///
/// The return value in this example is used as the index for a switch statement.
/// One advantage of using an enum as the return value and then using that to
/// drive a switch statement is that the analyzer will flag any switch statement
/// that doesn't mention every value in the enum.

/// Future<Null> _askedToLead() async {
